      <h2>Personal Reflective story</h2>
	    <h3>(Draft)</h3>

      <p>During the first week of Project 1 semester 2 2017 I chose to join the Internet of Things project group because I have a slight interest for embedded systems and programming hardware. During the first week our group leader Thomas was very helpful with the new team members and gave us all of the appropriate links to join the new Slack channel and review the history of the group on MatterMost.</p> 
<p>During the second and third week of being part of the IoT group the new members were assigned tasks to work on to grasp a deeper understanding of what LoRaWAN is and why we chose to use it. We all separated these tasks between us so we could all work on them together. I conducted research on LoRaWAN, IoT and how to convert research into markdown format as I was the one converting our research for the tasks into readable markdown files for the website. At the start a few of us were pushing our changes directly to the main repository for the website this was quite tedious so we were advised to create a local version of the GitHub pages used a Jekyll bundler. I found this to be a great idea as I could edit styling for the LoRaWAN research and watch the changes change live on my local machine. </p>
<p>In my fourth week the other two new members that were also working on the tasks sent me their copies of the research so I could convert this research into markdown format and push it to the website.  Patrick (who is also a new member to the group) sent me a copy of his frequent asked questions page which I converted to markdown. I also did a lot of styling for the navigation bar and research pages by adding links to the new research and under the dropdown menu in the navigation bar. Editing for the website came very easy to me and I could just go in and do the job.</p>
<p>The next week shared little difference from the week before, I spent a lot of time documenting work from the previous week and expanding the LoRaWAN section on the home page of the website. I finished my second task this week which was to compare the features and functionality between LoRaWAN and other technologies. I found this task to be very intuitive as it gave me a deeper understanding of LoRaWAN and gave me an insight of why the group prioritized it over the other potential technologies. I finished off the week by adding a network diagram to the home page on the website of our network infrastructure, thankfully the network diagram was hidden in the MatterMost history and I had to dig around to find a poster with the containing image which I cropped out and added to the website. </p>
