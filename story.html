      <h1>Personal Reflective Story</h1>

      <p>For Project 1 I chose to join the Internet of Things project group because I have an interest for embedded systems and programming hardware. During the first week our group supervisor Thomas was very helpful with the new team members and gave us all of the appropriate links to join the new <a href="op-iot.slack.com">Slack channel</a> and review the history of the group on <a href="https://mattermost.op-bit.nz/ ">MatterMost</a>.</p>
      <p>During the second and third weeks of being part of the IoT's group, the new members were assigned tasks to work on to grasp a deeper understanding of what LoRaWAN is and why we chose to use it, an example of the Tasks we were assigned can be found <a href="assets\img\task1ForNewStudents.docx">here</a>. We separated these tasks between us so we could all work on them together. I conducted research on LoRaWAN, IoT and how to convert research into markdown format as I was the one converting our research for the tasks into readable markdown files for the website. At the start a few of us were pushing our changes directly to the main repository for the website, this was quite tedious, so we were advised to create a local version of the GitHub pages using a Jekyll bundler, as you can see <a href="assets\img\initialLocalJekyll.png">here</a>. I found this to be a great idea as I could edit styling for the LoRaWAN research and watch the changes take live effect on my local machine.</p>
      <p>In my fourth week the other two new members that were also working on the given tasks, Nick and Patrick sent me their copies of the research so I could convert this research into markdown format and push it to the website. Patrick sent me a copy of <a href="assets\img\patTask1Files.png">his research</a> on frequently asked questions (FAQ) for the website which I converted into markdown. After doing this I implemented a <a href="assets\img\addedFAQButton.png">new button</a> to link to the FAQ page on the main navigation bar. I also did a lot of styling for the navigation bar and the research section by adding links to the new research and under the dropdown menu in the navigation bar. This did not take that long as it was mainly basic styling changes and connecting the pages up.</p>
      <p>The next week shared little difference from the week before, I spent a lot of time documenting work from the previous week and expanding the LoRaWAN section on the home page of the website. Where I sourced the information for my research on LoRaWAN:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.lora-alliance.org/technology">What is LoRa?</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://enablingsupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205089362-What-is-the-difference-between-LoRa-and-LoRaWAN">What is the difference between LoRa and LoRaWan?</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.rfwireless-world.com/Terminology/Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-Lora-or-LoRaWAN.html">Pros and Cons of LoRaWan</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://docs.mbed.com/docs/lora-with-mbed/en/latest/intro-to-lora/">Information on LoRa compatible devices</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>I finished my second task this week which was to compare the features and functionality between LoRaWAN and other technologies. I found this task to be very interesting as it gave me a deeper understanding of LoRaWAN and gave me an insight of why the group preferred it over the other potential technologies. I finished off the week by adding a network diagram to the home page of the website of our network infrastructure, thankfully the network diagram was hidden in the MatterMost history and I had to dig around to find a poster with the containing image which I cropped out and added to the website, which can be viewed <a href="assets\img\IOT Poster.jpg">here</a></p>
      <p>During week six I made changes to the website home page by adding the ‘Current status’ and ‘Future goals’ sections. I also documented research on LoRaWAN and compared them with other technologies on the home page, an example of my code is found <a href="assets\img\updatingWebHomePage.png">here</a>. At this stage Patrick had already handed me all of the research that was required of him for Task one and I had finished mine, however I was still waiting on Nick to finish with his research and documentation so I could convert it to markdown format and upload it to the website. When working on the website we ran into a few problems with the links not redirecting to their designated locations as the links were hard-coded. This required research on Base URL’s for Jekyll and <a href="assets\img\makingRelativeLinks.png">creating dynamic relative links</a>. This was an easy fix but time consuming as I had to go through all of the code, changing all the hard-coded links into relative ones so if the location was changed by someone in the group the links would dynamically find the new location and redirect as requested.</p>
      <p>In week 7 I expanded the ‘Our Mission’ section on the home page of the website by adding more details about what our team is doing and our plans. I also expanded the website by adding a section about the Network Infrastructure which included: details about the infrastructure, a network diagram and fixing some spelling mistakes on the network diagram, you can view this work <a href="assets\img\networkInfrastructure.png">here</a>.</p>
      <p>During week 8 there was a frustrating problem with the website resizing and all of the content being squashed together, this also happened when viewed on a mobile device. I fixed this by using the following code <a href="assets\img\autosizingDropdownCommit.png">here</a>. I also added a new page to the website called Quick Start and linked it on the navigation bar. The Quick Start page described how to access the LoRaWAN network and setting up your own LoRa equipment. I also added the Dunedin IoT contact email to the bottom of the FAQ page to allow users to ask questions that weren’t covered in the page or offer suggestions. After these alterations to the website, Zoe and I decided to hold a meeting with the members of the group to discuss the content on the website and offer suggestions for changes or what could be added. </p>
      <p>In week 9 I removed a link to the server page in the dropdown menu of the website because we decided to move the server information to a subsection of server development. After a meeting with the team I decided to help Patrick with the Dragino Shields node configuration. This was a big step up for me as I have never worked with programming hardware before and I had no idea how any of it worked, so I went home and began researching Arduino and Dragino Shields. Thomas linked me to his Dragino node configuration for Australia and NZ frequencies on his portfolio which can be found <a href="http://thomaslaurenson.com/projects/DraginoLoRaShield.html ">here</a>. I retrieved a <a href="https://github.com/dragino/Lora/blob/master/Lora%20Shield/Examples/lora_shield_ttn-915-fix-frequency/lora_shield_ttn-915-fix-frequency.ino">file</a> from his online portfolio which I analyzed to gain further understanding of how it all works. </p>
      <p>During week 10 Zoe and I <a href="assets\img\implementBootstrapCollab.png">implemented a Bootstrap theme</a> for the website that I obtained from Nick as he was researching Bootstrap themes to style the website. The team approved of his selection and it was mine and Zoe’s job to implement it. After that there were a few problems linking the pages as we had to go back through our code and restructure the links to the other pages, luckily, we had made these relative so it wasn’t as tedious as it would have been if we left them hard-coded. After implementing the Bootstrap theme there were a couple CSS styling clashes/problems that we had to fix to apply the correct styling for the website. I concluded this week by adding an “About Us” <a href="https://otagopolytechnic.github.io/DunedinIoT/about.html">page</a> to the website which included blurbs about each member of the project and adding a silhouette image of each member. </p>
      <p>Throughout week 11 I made changes to the <a href="https://otagopolytechnic.github.io/DunedinIoT/development/nodes/dragino915Shield/README.html">Dragino Shield tutorial</a> that I made on the website. This included making changes to the Quick start guide and making it flow better and give a greater understanding of how it works and what’s needed to reach full functionality. The following week I added a Quick start guide to the said web page which I got Patrick to review my changes and to run through the tutorial testing it out for himself to make sure it was readable and achieved the result we wanted. </p>
      <p>In week 13 we started beginning work on showcase as it was only a few weeks away and there was a lot of work for us to do. This included working with Patrick on implementing the Google Maps API into the <a href="http://iot.op-bit.nz">showcase website</a>. Luckily, I already had experience with working with the Google Maps API during the previous semester working in Software engineering implementing it for the “MealsOnWheels” application and during my Mobile Web paper which I had to make a random GPS geolocation app which put a marker in a random city in the world. This gave me the knowledge to put the markers based on GPS location on the map which is where we would have the nodes located. This was a job which we were expected to work on for the full week, however because of my previous experience on working with the Google Maps API I was able to do this in half an hour, however this left Patrick with little work to do for the week. But I did collaborate with Patrick as seen here, to help him grasp a deeper understanding of <a href="assets\img\cleanJavaScript.png">my code</a> so he could understand how it all worked.</p>
      <p>During week 14 we had a meeting with the team and were suggested more ideas to add to the map, including: having the marker display a brief description of the node when the marker is clicked. Fortunately, I had already implemented this functionality into the code as I thought it would be a good idea to bring up in the meeting. So, Patrick and I <a href="assets\img\collabPatrick.png">collaborated ideas</a> to get more creative with it; that is when I added the functionality of having the user hover over the marker to display the brief description of the node and when the marker was clicked, it would redirect the user to a page with that specific node displaying the moisture readings for that node. Now all that was left for the week was to get a deeper understanding of the Dragino Shield and to read the values from the moisture sensor. Patrick and I were advised to get similar functionality code from Brendan which he had already used to make a temperature/humidity sensor and converted his programmatic logic to read the moisture readings from the nodes moisture sensor. </p>
      <p>Week 15 was a busy week, Patrick and I spent a lot of time merging <a href="https://otagopolytechnic.github.io/DunedinIoT/development/nodes/dragino868TempHumidLDR/Dragino868TempHumidLDR.ino">Brendan’s code</a> for the Dragino Shield with <a href="assets\img\lora_shield_ttn-915-fix-frequency.ino" download>ours</a> to achieve the functionality of reading the data from the sensors. After a good couple hours, we got the correct data from the sensors and made attempts at sending that data in packets to the Server’s gateway, an example of this working can be found <a href="assets\img\packetsSentToGateway.png">here</a>. I managed to get this working on my computer, however Patrick ran into problems getting his working, which was curious as I had shared my code with him, therefore our code matched. After Patrick made various attempts at using different Dragino Shields and nodes to get it working we came to the conclusion that the problem was with his computer. This wasn’t too big a problem as the nodes wouldn’t be connected to the computer when they were in real practice, so we continued without wasting time on fixing this minor problem. After we got all the moisture nodes working and sending the correct data to the gateway, I decided to help Zoe style the showcase website and adding a more succinct navigation system to the website as Thomas’s phone’s back button was broken so he couldn’t navigate the website, which turned out to be helpful as we had to acknowledge various contexts e.g., a non-functioning back button on a phone. After <a href="assets\img\implementNavBarOnShowcase.png">implementing the navigation bar</a>, I worked with Zoe to link all of the nodes talking to the gateway to their appropriate pages on the show case website. </p>
